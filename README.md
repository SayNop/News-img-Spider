# News-img-Spider

## Discription
A very very easy spider based on Scrapy.
(Of course, the whole process has a key point that has been described in the postscript.)

## Some python package
requests==2.25.1
Scrapy==2.4.1
selenium==3.141.0

## Postscript
Do not use selenium to open an image url.
Scrapy will get a response of html about processing image so that ImagePipeline can not handle this kind of response.
So be cautious.
